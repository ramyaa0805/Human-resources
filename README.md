# Human Resources Analytics Project

This project leverages **HR analytics and Tableau dashboards** to help managers and business leaders make **data-driven decisions** about employee retention, development, and recruitment.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The analysis is based on the **HRDataset_v14 (2023)**, which contains employee-level data covering demographics, employment history, performance, and satisfaction. Using Tableau, we built interactive dashboards to visualize and analyze key HR metrics.

## ðŸ”‘ Key Dashboards

1. **Demographics Dashboard** â€“ Age, gender ratio, education, department/position counts.
2. **Attrition Dashboard** â€“ Attrition trends, termination reasons, breakdown by demographics.
3. **Performance & Satisfaction Dashboard** â€“ Performance ratings, department-wise satisfaction, employee feedback.
4. **Hiring & Recruitment Dashboard** â€“ Hiring trends, recruitment sources, time-to-fill positions.

## ðŸ“Œ Analytical Findings

* Higher attrition among younger employees (<30) and specific job roles.
* Moderate gender imbalance in technical departments.
* Lower job satisfaction in technical roles compared to administrative staff.
* Strong hiring channels: **Referrals & LinkedIn**, but delays for senior role hiring.
* High performers show lower attrition risk and stronger outcomes under experienced managers.

## ðŸš€ Strategic Recommendations

* Strengthen engagement initiatives for younger employees.
* Launch mentorship programs to reduce early-career attrition.
* Invest in **diversity hiring** for technical roles.
* Conduct regular satisfaction surveys and career development programs.
* Optimize recruitment by focusing on high-performing channels (referrals, LinkedIn) and streamlining senior role hiring.

## âœ… Conclusion

This HR Analytics project demonstrates how **data visualization and analytics** can enhance HR management by offering **clear, actionable insights** into workforce trends. By using Tableau dashboards, HR leaders can continuously monitor progress, set benchmarks, and make **evidence-based decisions** to improve retention, diversity, and recruitment efficiently.
